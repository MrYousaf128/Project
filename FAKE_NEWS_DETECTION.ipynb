You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed. The soldier has better access to the Secretary of State than U.S. reporters do.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Join Patrick every week here at 21WIRE.TV for news, views and analysis on all top stories domestically and abroad THIS WEEK: Episode 4 The New World Order  Did Great Britain regain control of its former American colonies by stealth?

He would send me press clippings about me that he would just sign  Donald Trump.  And he called from time to time to compliment a segment. I didn t know why he was doing that. And then when he announced that he was running for president, it became more clear. But I can t be wooed. I was never going to love him, and I was never going to hate him. Indeed, Kelly has refused to take shit from Trump. During a debate in August, Kelly took Trump on and didn t make things easy for him. Offended, Trump lashed out at Kelly, claiming she was bleeding out of her  whatever. Even after Kelly went on vacation, Trump continued the vicious assaults with the help of his rapid conservative supporters.And now Trump has responded to Kelly s remarks in Vanity Fair by attacking her once again, this time targeting her for her looks and claiming that nobody wants to woo her. Megyn Kelly recently said that she can t be wooed by Trump,  the billionaire Republican presidential wannabe wrote on Twitter.  She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her! .@megynkelly recently said that she can t be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2016And, of course, Trump is only embarrassing himself. Say what you want about her political beliefs, it is undeniable that Megyn Kelly is not only a beautiful woman, she has a brain as well. Also, it s pretty ridiculous to say that nobody wants to woo her since she has been married twice. Clearly, at least two men have succeeded in wooing her while Donald Trump has failed repeatedly. It sounds like Trump is just jealous because a smart and sexy woman said  no  to him and refused to let him walk all over her.Featured Image: YouTube\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Friday his conversations with President-elect Donald Trump have been cordial and in some cases he made specific suggestions and offered thoughts about  maintaining the integrity of democratic institutions. \\u201cHe has listened.
